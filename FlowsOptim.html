<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Network problems most naturally arise in the study of optimization
and operations research. A typical graph theory student will have seen
that finding the maximum flow though a network tells us where our
network has a bottleneck in capacity and such a problem naturally arises
in applications such as the design of physical networks for road systems
and other utilities. Now clearly this single problem does not tell the
whole story. For example say you actually have specific amount of total
flow which is obviously less than or equal to the maximum, and that you
would like to distribute from source to sink in some optimal way. To
discuss such problems it is perhaps more intuitive to consider an
optimization (specifically linear programming) based approach, rather
than a graph theoretic approach.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-graph-theory-terminology" class="section level1">
<h1>Graph Theory Terminology</h1>
<p>A <em>graph</em> is defined by a set of vertices and a set of edges,
i.e., we define a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> like so
<span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a set of vertices, and <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> is a set of edges. <em>Vertices</em>
(also called nodes or points) are simply mathematical abstractions of
the objects in our problems. In the context of road systems, a vertex
could represent an intersection or a general location. An <em>edge</em>
(also called link or line) is simply an ordered pair of vertices, meant
to describe the relationship between vertices. Again, in the context of
road systems, an edge might represent the street connecting two
locations or intersections. An <em>arc</em> (or directed edge) defines a
relation between two vertices that is not symmetric, meaning if vertex
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is related to vertex <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, it is not guaranteed that vertex <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is related to vertex <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. In the context of road systems, one
could think of arcs as one-way streets. A <em>path</em> is a sequence of
distinct arcs connecting two vertices with no repeated vertices. We say
that a graph is <em>connected</em> if, for every pair of vertices, there
exists a path connecting them. A <em>cycle</em> is a path that begins
and ends at the same vertex. A <em>tree</em> is a graph with no cycles.
A <em>subgraph</em> is a graph whose vertex and edge set is a subset of
a larger graph, i.e., let <span class="math inline">\(G = (V,
E)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A = (V&#39;,
E&#39;)\)</span> is a subgraph if <span class="math inline">\(V&#39;
\subseteq V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E&#39; \subseteq
E\)</span>. A <em>spanning tree</em> is a subgraph that contains every
vertex and is also a tree.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-a-primer-in-linear-optimization"
class="section level1">
<h1>A Primer in Linear Optimization</h1>
<p>A <em>Linear Programming (LP) Problem</em> is simply an optimization
problem where the objective function and constraints are linear. Here is
a quick example. Note that it has both equality and inequality
constraints,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{minimize: }}_{x} z = -x_1 - &amp;2x_2\\
\text{subject to: } -2x_1 + x_2 &amp;= 2\\
-x_1 + x_2 &amp;\leq 3\\
x_1, x_2 &amp;\geq 0
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>We call the <em>Feasible Set</em>, usually denoted by <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, the set of all points for which the
constraints are satisfied. Note that for LP problems, this set <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is always convex. Now, as an aside, the
term “convex” is overloaded in optimization, and it’s used to describe
both a property of the feasible set, where any segment between a pair of
points is contained in the set, and the objective function, where for
any given point, the function is above its tangent plane. Rest assured
for LP problems, our functions and feasible sets are convex, leading to
a fundamental result which will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Now we say an LP problem is in <em>standard form</em> if it has only
nonnegative inequality constraints, with <span class="math inline">\(b
\geq 0\)</span>,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{minimize: }}_{x} z &amp;= c^Tx\\
\text{subject to: }Ax &amp;= b\\
x &amp;\geq 0
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Take note that in this formulation, <span class="math inline">\(x, c
\in \mathbb{R}^n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \in
\mathbb{R}^m\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> is the solution space, <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the number of equality constraints,
and we have specifically chosen to minimize the objective function. We
will often refer to <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathbb{R}^{m
\times n}\)</span> as the <em>constraint matrix</em>. It is important to
note that <em>all</em> LP problems can be converted into standard form,
often at the expense of increasing the dimension of the solution space,
but we will suppress the details for now as it is not particularly
relevant to our discussion of flow problems.</p>
<p>We say a solution <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a
<em>basic feasible solution</em> if the columns of the constraint matrix
corresponding to the non-zero components of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> are linearly independent (form a basis,
hence ‘basic’), and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> satisfies all
equality and nonnegativity constraints (hence ‘feasible’).</p>
<p>Finally, we reach the most important result to remember with the
<em>Fundamental Theorem of Linear Programming</em>, which states that
for an LP problem in standard form, <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is an extreme point of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> if and only if <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a basic feasible solution.
Furthermore, if an LP problem has a finite optimal solution (which would
be guaranteed by convexity if <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is
bounded), then the optimal solution is a basic feasible solution.</p>
<p>Now onto duality! For an LP problem in standard form, which we will
refer to as the primal problem, we define its <em>dual</em> LP problem
as,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{maximize: }}_{y} w &amp;= b^Ty\\
\text{subject to: }A^Ty &amp;= c\\
y &amp;\geq 0
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that in this problem <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> have been swapped between the
constraint equation and the objective function, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> has been transposed, and we are now
maximizing the objective function. There are many ideas to glean from
the topic of Duality Theory. For brevity, we will only discuss
<em>Strong Duality</em>, which states that for a pair of primal and dual
LP problems, if one has an optimal solution, then so does the other, and
the optimal objective values are equal. [Hint: This should remind you of
max flow = min cut].</p>
<p>All this leads to the main idea of the <em>simplex algorithm</em>,
the main workhorse for solving LP problems, which is to find the optimal
solution by simply traversing the extreme points of <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and certify that our solution is
optimal with the dual. Now, I’ve suppressed many of the details, but
hopefully, this is enough to get through our discussion surrounding the
different variations of flow problems. Extra discussion of the
<em>network simplex algorithm</em> is in the appendix of the paper.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-types-of-network-problems" class="section level1">
<h1>Types of Network Problems</h1>
<p>As we will see, there are several different flavors of network
problems. A typical graph theory student would be familiar with the
<em>maximum-flow problem</em> and its dual, the <em>minimum-cut
problem</em>. But we can also formulate the <em>shortest-path
problem</em> and the <em>assignment (matching) problem</em> as network
problems. To see this, we will be formulating these problems as special
forms of the more generalized <em>Minimum Cost Network Flow
Problem</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-minimum-cost-network-flow-problem"
class="section level1">
<h1>Minimum Cost Network Flow Problem</h1>
<p>Suppose you have a directed graph (or network) where each vertex is
assigned a value of flow, and the weights assigned to the edges
represent the cost of moving one unit of flow. Consider the example
below, where <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (the circled
numbers) is a vector of flow and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>
(the numbers near the edges) is a vector of cost values. Assume flow at
a vertex is 0 unless stated otherwise.</p>
<div id="section-figure-1-graph-g-v-e-with-flow-b-and-weights-c."
class="section level4">
<h4>Figure 1: Graph <span class="math inline">\(G = (V, E)\)</span> with
flow <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and weights <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</h4>
<p><img src="FlowsProjectImages/SampleNetwork.png" style="width:100%" align="center"/></p>
<p>If a vertex has positive flow, we call it a source, and if a vertex
has negative flow, we call it a sink. We define Supply, <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S = \sum_{\{i : b_i &gt; 0\}} b_i,
\]</span></p>
<p>and Demand, <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
D = \sum_{\{i: b_i &lt; 0\}} b_i.
\]</span></p>
<p>We call a network balanced if <span class="math inline">\(S + D =
0\)</span>, and an unbalanced network can be made balanced by adding an
artificial vertex with flow <span class="math inline">\(S - D\)</span>
via a directed edge with zero cost.</p>
<p>The goal of the minimum cost network flow problem is to satisfy the
supply and demand of each vertex while minimizing the cost. Naturally,
the objective function will look like this,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mathop{\text{minimize: }}_{x} z = c^Tx
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,j} \in x\)</span> represents
the amount of flow through arc <span class="math inline">\((i,
j)\)</span>, and we denote <span class="math inline">\(c_{i, j}\)</span>
as the cost assigned to arc <span class="math inline">\((i, j)\)</span>.
It’s important to note that at this moment we are thinking of <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> as vectors, so this indexing is just
for identifying the corresponding arc, not some location on a matrix. A
feasible solution to this problem is an <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> which satisfies the supply and demand
of each vertex. With that context, at each vertex <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, our <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> must satisfy,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\sum_{j} x_{i,j} - \sum_{k} x_{k,i} = b_i.
\]</span></p>
<p>One can think of the first sum as flow out of vertex <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and the second sum as flow into vertex
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. As an example, consider vertices
1 and 2 in Figure 1; we get the following constraints:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x_{1, 2} + x_{1,3} = 50,
\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x_{2, 4} + x_{2, 6} - x_{1, 2} = 0.
\]</span></p>
<p>This is done for each vertex <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>,
generating our constraint matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>,
which will be of size (number of vertices) <span
class="math inline">\(\times\)</span> (number of edges). Usually, there
will be some added constraints <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> on the amount of flow that
can go through each edge (Capacity!!), so most problems will be of the
form,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{minimize: }}_{x} z &amp;= c^Tx\\
\text{subject to: }Ax &amp;= b\\
L \leq &amp;x \leq U
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Consider the well-posedness of such a problem, specifically for a
given <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> which is small, and an
assignment of flows <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> which is very
large. (This situation has a name, and we typically call an LP problem
<em>infeasible</em> when this happens).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="section-maximum-flow" class="section level1">
<h1>Maximum Flow</h1>
<p>Suppose you have a directed graph with <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> vertices but in this case, we only
consider two special vertices, 1 and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, where 1 is the source and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the sink. The weights assigned to
each arc represent the maximum capacity of flow that can move between
vertices.</p>
<p>The goal of a maximum flow network problem is to maximize the amount
of flow through the source and the sink without overwhelming the
capacity of the network. So, a solution to the maximum flow network
problem determines the maximal amount of flow that can be moved from
source to sink, as well as the routing of that flow across the
network.</p>
<p>To formulate the problem as a linear program, let <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i, j} \in x\)</span> represent the amount of
flow through arc <span class="math inline">\((i, j)\)</span>, and let
<span class="math inline">\(u_{i, j}\)</span> represent the capacity of
arc <span class="math inline">\((i, j)\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be the amount of flow in the network.
Then our problem can be written in the following form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{maximize: }}_{x, f} &amp; \quad z = f\\
\text{subject to: } &amp; \quad \sum_{j} x_{1,j} - \sum_{k} x_{k,1} =
f,\\
&amp; \quad \sum_{j} x_{i,j} - \sum_{k} x_{k,i} = 0, \quad i = 2, \dots,
m - 1,\\
&amp; \quad \sum_{j} x_{m,j} - \sum_{k} x_{k,m} = -f,\\
&amp; \quad 0 \leq x_{i,j} \leq u_{i,j}.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Naturally, since we wish to find the maximum flow <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> between vertices 1 and <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> through the network, vertex 1 will have
a surplus of flow <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and vertex
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> will have a demand of flow <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. Since all the flow is moving from 1 to
<span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, all vertices in between must be
balanced, hence the 0 on the right-hand side of the middle equality
constraints. Finally, the inequality constraints come from our desire to
not overwhelm the capacity of the network.</p>
<p>We can convert the maximum flow problem into a minimum cost network
flow problem. Suppose we add an artificial arc <span
class="math inline">\((m, 1)\)</span> with unlimited capacity <span
class="math inline">\(u_{1, m}\)</span>. Then the problem can be
reformulated by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{minimize: }}_{x} &amp; \quad z = -x_{m, 1}\\
\text{subject to: } &amp; \quad \sum_{j} x_{i,j} - \sum_{k} x_{k,i} = 0,
\quad i = 1, \dots, m,\\
&amp; \quad 0 \leq x_{i,j} \leq u_{i,j}.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>To see this, let <span class="math inline">\(x_{m,1} = f\)</span> and
by substitution, the constraints are equivalent. Since minimum cost
network flow is a minimization problem, we multiply the cost function by
-1, hence <span class="math inline">\(z = -x_{m,1}\)</span>. To see this
in the previously stated matrix-vector form of the minimum cost network
flow problem, let <span class="math inline">\(b = 0\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> be a one-hot vector with <span
class="math inline">\(c_{m,1} = -1\)</span>, let <span
class="math inline">\(L = 0\)</span>, and let <span
class="math inline">\(U = u\)</span>, a vector of arc capacities. Note
that the cost <span class="math inline">\(c_{i,j} = 0\)</span> for all
edges in our graph other than our strategically placed artificial
arc.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-minimum-cut" class="section level1">
<h1>Minimum Cut</h1>
<p>Since we’ve described the maximum flow problem as an LP problem, we
can easily convert it to standard form and construct its dual LP
problem. From our discussions in class, strong duality states that such
a dual should compute the minimum cut on this network. Let’s verify that
for ourselves. Since I’ve suppressed the details of how to convert an LP
problem to standard form, I’ll simply present you with the dual of the
original problem and argue it produces the minimum cut:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{minimize: }}_{y, v} &amp; \quad w = \sum u_{i,j} v_{i,j}\\
\text{subject to: } &amp; \quad y_m - y_1 = 1,\\
&amp; \quad y_i - y_j + v_{i,j} \geq 0, \quad \text{for all arcs }
(i,j),\\
&amp; \quad v_{i,j} \geq 0.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>First, let’s define <span class="math inline">\(N_1\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(N_0\)</span> to be the independent sets of
vertices. We would like our dual variable <span
class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> to encode when a vertex is in either
<span class="math inline">\(y_i \in N_1\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(y_i \in N_0\)</span>. In order to satisfy the
first constraint, it is clear that <span class="math inline">\(y_m =
1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y_1 = 0\)</span>, as desired,
since our source and sink must be separated. We interpret the second
dual variable <span class="math inline">\(v_{i,j}\)</span> as an
indicator for if an arc is in the cut set, so <span
class="math inline">\(v_{i,j} = 1\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(i \in N_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j \in N_0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(v_{i,j} = 0\)</span> otherwise. We are pleased to
find that the objective is what we expect: minimizing a sum of
capacities over arcs in the cut set. Now, finally, if <span
class="math inline">\(y_i \in N_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y_j \in N_1\)</span>, we force <span
class="math inline">\(y_i - y_j = -1\)</span> and in order to stay
feasible, <span class="math inline">\(v_{i,j} = 1\)</span>; hence, we
get the desired quality for our indicator <span
class="math inline">\(v_{i,j}\)</span>. A similar argument shows that
arcs between vertices in the same set can be added to the cut set as
well.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-shortest-path" class="section level1">
<h1>Shortest Path</h1>
<p>The shortest path problem can be represented very simply as a minimum
cost network flow problem. First, you construct the directed graph in
the obvious way to model the physical network you are trying to
traverse. The starting source vertex is ascribed a flow of 1, and the
ending sink vertex with a flow of -1, defining the <span
class="math inline">\(c_{i,j}\)</span> as the distance between vertices
<span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</p>
<p>As an aside, it should be noted that there are several especially
efficient algorithms for solving the shortest path problem (A* and
Dijkstra’s come to mind), and this formulation via a minimum cost
network flow problem is by no means any better (the method in the
appendix is a polynomial time algorithm). However, it is more general in
the sense that the more popular algorithms require that the cost <span
class="math inline">\(c_{i,j} \geq 0\)</span> and our formulation allows
us the case where <span class="math inline">\(c_{i,j} &lt; 0\)</span> as
well. (In fact, it was only recently found that such a negative weight
efficient near-linear time shortest path algorithm exists.)</p>
</div>
<div id="section-assignment" class="section level1">
<h1>Assignment</h1>
<p>Let’s recall the premise of the stable matching problem, where a
collection of medical students are applying to medical residencies and
instead of creating a list of preferences, the students decide to
ascribe a happiness score <span class="math inline">\(c_{i,j}\)</span>
for which the <span class="math inline">\(i^{th}\)</span> student would
attain should they be accepted to the <span
class="math inline">\(j^{th}\)</span> program. You can think of this as
a sort of weighted preference list. The goal of the assignment problem
is to assign each student to a program and maximize the total amount of
‘happiness’.</p>
<p>Again, the graph is constructed in the usual way, as a complete
bipartite graph with one part representing students and another
representing medical residencies (it is necessary to have equal parts).
Every student source vertex is ascribed a flow of 1, and every school
sink vertex with a flow of -1. We assign the costs as expected using the
happiness score <span class="math inline">\(c_{i,j}\)</span>; however,
this time we want to maximize the objective function.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-applications-in-image-segmentation"
class="section level1">
<h1>Applications in Image Segmentation</h1>
<p>Extending our discussion of Flow Problems, I’d like to discuss a
particularly interesting application of the Max-Flow/Min-Cut problem in
the field of computer vision. Image segmentation is the process by which
the subject and background of an image are identified. To apply our
knowledge about flow problems, we would hope to define a graph where
each vertex represents a pixel or some portion of the image, and
capacities, source vertices, and sink vertices such that the Min-Cut
separates our subject from the background.</p>
<p>This idea is called ‘Lazy Snapping’ and it works by first presenting
a user with an image. The user then selects a small portion of the
subject in the image to be source pixels, and another portion of the
background to be sink pixels. Then the goal is to find the assignment
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> of pixels into two classes where
<span class="math inline">\(X(x_i) = 1\)</span> (subject) or <span
class="math inline">\(X(x_i) = 0\)</span> (background) which minimizes
the following energy function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
E(X) = \sum_{i \in V} E_1(x_i) + \lambda \sum_{(i, j) \in E} E_2(x_i,
x_j).
\]</span></p>
<p>There is a substantial amount of details which I will suppress, but
essentially <span class="math inline">\(E_1\)</span> is defined in such
a way that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i \in V} E_1(x_i)\)</span>
is small if pixels of the same class are the same color. Also, <span
class="math inline">\(E_2\)</span> is constructed such that it only
takes on positive values for which <span
class="math inline">\(x_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_j\)</span> are in different classes; otherwise,
it is zero. It is larger when the two colors are similar and smaller
when they are dissimilar. Having described the energy function in this
way, there should be a feeling that minimizing <span
class="math inline">\(E\)</span> must separate a subject from its
background. Actually producing the capacities for such a graph and
proving that the Min-Cut algorithm minimizes this energy function will
be left to the references in the demo below,</p>

<div id="section-network-simplex" class="section level1">
<h1>Network Simplex</h1>
<div id="section-feasibility" class="section level2">
<h2>Feasibility</h2>
<p>The crux of the network simplex method lies in two key ideas, which
we will explore in the context of a minimum cost network flow problem
with only positivity constraints. Let <span class="math inline">\(G =
(V, E)\)</span> be a network on <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>
vertices and recall the minimum cost network flow problem:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
\mathop{\text{minimize: }}_{x} z &amp;= c^Tx\\
\text{subject to: } Ax &amp;= b\\
x &amp;\geq 0
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>By our definition of <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,j} \in
x\)</span> as the flow between arc <span
class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>, we know that the columns of our
constraint matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> represent the
arcs in our network. Since we constructed each row of our matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> as an equation which models the flow
across a single vertex, we know that each row represents a vertex. So,
in the column view, a column representing arc <span
class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> will have a 1 in the row
representing vertex <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and a -1 in
the row representing vertex <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. In
the row view, a row representing vertex <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> will have a 1 in every column
representing arc <span class="math inline">\((i,k)\)</span> and a -1 in
every column representing arc <span
class="math inline">\((k,i)\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(k \in V\)</span>. Hence, the constraint matrix is
a directed incidence matrix. The first big idea comes as the following
theorem:</p>
<div class="theorem" text="Theorem 1:">
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> be a submatrix of the
constraint matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> whose columns
represent the edges of a spanning tree. Then <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is a full column rank matrix with
dimension <span class="math inline">\(m \times (m - 1)\)</span>, and it
can be rearranged so that the diagonal entries are <span
class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
There is a sense that this result feels intuitive. Clearly, a spanning
tree on a connected graph with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>
vertices must have <span class="math inline">\(m - 1\)</span> arcs.
Showing that <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can be rearranged
follows by a proof by induction (you can find it on p.285 of Griva).</p>
<p>Recall that a basic solution <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
to a general LP problem has non-zero entries, whose corresponding
columns in the constraint matrix <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
are linearly independent, and <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
satisfies the equality constraints. We define a <em>spanning tree
solution</em> <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> as a solution to
the system <span class="math inline">\(Ax = b\)</span> where the
non-zero entries of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> correspond to
columns of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> which represent a
spanning tree. A <em>feasible spanning tree solution</em> is simply a
spanning tree solution which also satisfies the positivity constraints,
<span class="math inline">\(x \geq 0\)</span>. The next big idea uses
the previous theorem and definitions about spanning trees and connects
them to LP:</p>
<div class="theorem" text="Theorem 2:">
<p>A flow <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a basic feasible
solution for the network flow constraints <span class="math inline">\(Ax
= b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x \geq 0\)</span> if and
only if it is a feasible spanning tree solution.</p>
</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The backwards direction follows directly from the previous Theorem 1
and the definition of a feasible spanning tree solution. The forwards
direction proceeds by contradiction. Suppose <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a basic feasible solution and not a
feasible spanning tree solution. If <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not a spanning tree, then it must
have a cycle. Choose a vertex <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in
the cycle; it must have arcs <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\((k,i)\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(j\)</span> in the cycle. The flow across an arc
<span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> in the cycle may be increased
by some <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon \geq 0\)</span>, and in
order to stay feasible, we must decrease the flow across the arc <span
class="math inline">\((k,i)\)</span>. So we have a new flow <span
class="math inline">\(x_{\epsilon}\)</span>, and we can construct
another flow <span class="math inline">\(x_{-\epsilon}\)</span> by
subtracting <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> from the flow
across <span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span> and adding <span
class="math inline">\(\epsilon\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\((k,i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, note that:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x = \frac{1}{2} x_{\epsilon} + \frac{1}{2} x_{-\epsilon}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not an extreme
point in the feasible set, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Linear
Programming, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is not a basic
feasible solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-the-network-simplex-method" class="section level2">
<h2>The Network Simplex Method</h2>
<p>The network simplex method proceeds in a similar fashion to the
general simplex method with a few improvements on how we compute each
step. First, note that we must initialize the algorithm, just like the
regular simplex method, with a basic feasible solution. One could
conceivably implement the first step problem to find a BFS. Like in the
regular simplex method, we’ll need to form our Basis and Null matrices
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> respectively. As we have shown in the
previous section, our <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> matrix will
be full column rank with dimension <span class="math inline">\(m \times
(m - 1)\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> matrix
will have columns which represent all the arcs that didn’t show up in
our feasible spanning tree. Recall that the first step in the simplex
method is to compute simplex multipliers <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> by solving the system,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
B^T y = c.
\]</span></p>
<p>Here is where we can take advantage of Theorem 1 to make solving this
system faster. Note that <span class="math inline">\(B^T\)</span> is a
full row rank <span class="math inline">\((m - 1) \times m\)</span>
matrix, so we are guaranteed when solving <span
class="math inline">\(B^T y = c\)</span> to have a free variable. Since
<span class="math inline">\(B^T\)</span> is a matrix whose rows now
represent edges, solving this system by back substitution produces the
following expression,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
y_i - y_j = c_{i,j}
\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y_j\)</span> are the simplex multipliers
associated with vertices <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(c_{i,j}\)</span> is the cost associated with arc
<span class="math inline">\((i,j)\)</span>. This means that we can
compute the simplex multipliers by selecting a vertex <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to correspond to our free simplex
multiplier, so we will let <span class="math inline">\(y_i = 0\)</span>
and compute the rest <span class="math inline">\(y_j\)</span> by
traversing the feasible spanning tree and computing <span
class="math inline">\(y_j = y_i - c_{i,j}\)</span> along the way.</p>
<p>Computing the reduced costs is no different from the regular simplex
method. We use <span class="math inline">\(\hat{c}_{i,j} = c_{i,j} - N^T
y\)</span>. Again, choosing which arc becomes the new entering arc is no
different: simply find the minimum <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{c}_{i,j}\)</span> and consider the
corresponding arc <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,j}\)</span> in the
columns of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>. Then we check our
optimality conditions just as before: are <span
class="math inline">\(\hat{c}_{i,j} \geq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>To choose our leaving arc, we will be taking advantage of Theorem 2
and a small result about spanning trees. Taking our entering arc <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i,j}\)</span> and adding it into our spanning
tree graph, it is guaranteed that this will produce a single undirected
cycle that includes the arc <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i,j}\)</span>. By Theorem 2, adding this arc
<span class="math inline">\(x_{i,j}\)</span> into our solution makes us
no longer basic. In order to stay feasible and basic, we must remove an
arc from the cycle to get back to a spanning tree and increase the flow
through <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,j}\)</span> an appropriate
amount to satisfy our equality constraints. Here’s the trick: locate the
edges in the cycle which point in the opposite direction as <span
class="math inline">\(x_{i,j}\)</span>; we’ll call them negative edges.
Let <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be the minimum flow through
those negative edges. Set <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,j} =
m\)</span> and subtract <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> from all
negative <span class="math inline">\(x_{l,k}\)</span> in the cycle. This
operation maintains basic feasibility since the minimum flow <span
class="math inline">\(x_{l,k}\)</span> arc gets removed from our
solution, becoming our exiting variable, and our entering variable is
increased enough to satisfy the equality constraints. Also, note that if
there is no minimum flow <span class="math inline">\(x_{l,k}\)</span>,
and <span class="math inline">\(x_{i,j}\)</span> can be increased
arbitrarily, then the problem is unbounded, just like in the regular
simplex method.</p>
<p>The steps are then repeated with the new feasible spanning tree
solution until we achieve the optimality conditions.</p>

<h4>Figure 3: Initial feasible spanning tree shown in green. Red is the
entering arc for this first iteration.</h4>
<p><img src="FlowsProjectImages/step1.png" style="width:100%" align="center"/></p>
<p>Our initial feasible spanning tree solution is outlined in green in
Figure 3. Again, the equations for computing the simplex multipliers
allow us to simply set the multiplier associated with vertex 1 to zero,
so we get <span class="math inline">\(y_1 = 0\)</span>. To solve the
next multiplier, we traverse the green spanning tree to vertex 3 and in
doing so we solve for <span class="math inline">\(y_3\)</span> with
<span class="math inline">\(y_3 = y_2 - c_{1,3} = 0 - 5 = -5\)</span>.
Solving the next multiplier, we get <span class="math inline">\(y_4 =
y_3 - c_{3,4} = -5 - 4 = -9\)</span> and so on.</p>
<p>Once we have the simplex multipliers together, we can solve for the
reduced costs of the non-basic arcs. Doing so, we can check our
optimality conditions, and in this case, there exist negative reduced
costs, so we continue. You’ll find that the reduced cost for <span
class="math inline">\(x_{3,6}\)</span> (marked in red in Figure 3) is
the lowest among the negative reduced costs and therefore becomes our
entering arc.</p>
<p>To solve for our exiting arc, consider the cycle formed by vertices
<span class="math inline">\(\{3, 4, 6\}\)</span>. Note that <span
class="math inline">\(x_{3,6}\)</span> is pointing in the
counterclockwise direction, and therefore we designate arcs <span
class="math inline">\(x_{3,4}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_{4,6}\)</span> as negative. Note that the
minimum flow across the negative arcs is equal, so when we subtract that
flow from <span class="math inline">\(x_{3,4}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_{4,6}\)</span> and add it to <span
class="math inline">\(x_{3,6}\)</span>, both <span
class="math inline">\(x_{3,4}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x_{4,6}\)</span> will be zero and we will get to
choose which of the two arcs becomes our exiting arc.</p>
<p>Choosing <span class="math inline">\(x_{3,4}\)</span> to be the
exiting arc and setting <span class="math inline">\(x_{3,6} =
10\)</span>, we arrive at the next feasible spanning tree solution.
Figure 4 shows the final iteration of this problem; the working out is
